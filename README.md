# homework2
this is the second homework assignment


My portfolio:

	What we have here are several web pages that are going to make up my portfolio for my coding course. As of right now there is no real content here that is in my portfolio, but what we do have is the layout finished, style and working links/nav bar. My primary motivation was to get this ready for when I do have some things I can put in my portfolio.

	I faced several challenges while making this. Mostly I had to figure out how to use bootstrap and how to manipulate pre-existing code from Bootstrap itself. This took quite some time as I was not exactly sure what I was locking for. In the end, I learned quite a bit about what I can do with bootstrap and how to mix and match existing code to make something new. I also learned how to get a web page to be responsive to other devices i.e. shrinking to fit the size of a phone or tablet without everything becoming unreadable.
	
In the future I may change up some of the color schemes. I tried my best to make sure the colors did not hurt the eyes of those visiting my page and also contrast in a manner that looks good. I still have a little ways to go to learn about color this way, so I would not be surprised if I have to come back later and make it even better.

	To get this to run, simply go to the github page this is located on, clone it your computer and make sure all the files are in their original order.
